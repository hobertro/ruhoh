If you have ever entered an authentic Chinese restaurant where you have to question whether the patrons all decided to simultaneously engage in argument with each other or are simply just (obnoxious and) talking very loudly, you might have likely experienced another phenomenon observed in Chinese culture: Fighting for the bill. If you haven't, it's something along the lines of Asian adults struggling to pull the small tray that holds the bill away from each other as if it were the world tug-o-war championships. As a naive kid, I thought "that's cool, I'd love to fight my friends/family for the bill so I could show them that I care about them too." From my understanding early on as a kid, I thought the adults all fight for the bill because they all wanted to show much they cared about each other and value each other as friends and family. The person paying for the bill shows the recipients "I care about your well-being and wanted to provide this great social experience between everyone and by paying for this bill I have become a facilitator of those things." Not far-fetched a notion at all right? However, after becoming an adult myself, I realized that there was another hidden message in paying for the bill: "Next time, (one of) you have to get me back!" Yup, I realized that there is no free-lunch, not even between good friends and family. If and when someone pays for the bill, and all parties accept the offer, everyone unknowningly has engaged in a hidden quid-pro-quo-ish social contract. Ideally, someone else would "voluntarily" engage in tug-o-war and become the next "facilitator of well-being and fun social experiences" for the next event. From my personal experience, the system works MOST OF THE TIME. Generally, my friends offer to pay for my drinks (both boba and alcoholic lol), lunch/dinner, etc etc. and I would just get them back the next time or vice-versa. I am even often surprised and left in awe when people who do not even have a source of income offer to pay!

But there are occasional times where the circle of [insert "favor" here] has gone around everyone with the exception of a few people who are reluctant to return the favor (whether it be paying the bill or...let's say...being the next designated driver). If the people who accepted a past offer and do not return a similar offer, they will have violated the hidden quid-pro-quo social contract between all parties involved.

And this is bad. What happens to that guy at the table who always eats all the food, drinks all the alcohol, yet never exerts a single ounce of energy to pull the tab away from everyone? What happens to the guy who always asks for rides but never volunteers to be the designated driver? They become "THAT GUY" who never pays, who is always short, who never wants to drive, the taker, and worst of all, the person who takes other people for granted. I personally believe that no one minds being used, in fact I think everyone likes being useful especially if they can provide a solution to a problem, but I also believe people mind being taken for granted and/or taken advantaged of. And thus, the other participants of the social contract would think "Man forget this person, they don't contribute to facillitating to happy fun times, all they want is to take take take."

Okay, you get all of that now. But whats up with the tug-o-war? Is it really necessary to be almost on the verge of literally FIGHTING for the bill? Haha. My father once told me that he had to send $600 dollars to each of his best friend's daughter's weddings. I asked "Why $600 and not $100?" His response: "Because [if I give any lower] I will lose face." If there is one thing that all Asian's inherently fear, it is "losing face" to friends and family. Which brings me back to why the tug-o-war competitions happen: Whether genuinely wanting to pay for the bill or not wanting to "lose face," they have to "on the surface" show that they want to pay. Otherwise, they're going to get giant "TAKER" stamp on their forehead.

Next time you see Chinese adults fighting for the bill, you know that they are doing it for multiple reasons. One might be to show good faith in providing a good meal, faciliating a good experience, or even just simply not trying to "lose face." We as friends and family must also keep in mind that we have to put in our share and contribute to giving back to those who gave to us, or otherwise we will be labeled as "THAT GUY WHO IS THE TAKER."
