When I was in high school, my greatest fear was that my personality would change and end up like one of my club advisors (who was about 29 years old at the time). She was snappy and had borderline bipolar mood swings, which I guess was caused by her having to go through a bad divorce. But I remember thinking "Damn, is this really what's going to happen when I'm 29 years old?" I feared that I was going to be an unhappy adult, going through a similar divorce, and randomly snapping at kids.

Lately I've been hanging out with people who are 3-4 years older than me, which hits the "30-year-old mark." I am happy to report that the majority of these 30 year olds (98.99%) of them are still hip. They like still like collecting sneakers, play Final Fantasy RPGs, play board/card games, make dirty jokes, and thankfully, still like to party (but just not as wild) . Being around them has put my fears of being a unhappy, unhip, uncool 25-30 year old to rest and has given me hope. Hanging out with them also made me realize its not really about what age you are, but its about what you want to do, staying true to what you want and being yourself. If you can do those things, you can be hip and happy at 30 years old. Thank you friends.
